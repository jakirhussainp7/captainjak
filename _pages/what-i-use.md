See what I use day-to-day for Hardware and Software

Inspired from [others](https://uses.tech/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, I've listed the Hardware and Software that I use daily. 

### Software

I use a variety of software every day. Professionally, I tend to use proprietary software defined by various clients based on project needs.

* [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) - My Primary OS. For drivers & library dependencies I'll seek support from large base of community forums. 
* [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11) - My secondary OS in dual boot scenario.  
* [OSINT VM](https://www.tracelabs.org/initiatives/osint-vm) - For all OSINT investigations and data reconnaissance, and cybercrime incident analysis I use the specialized Linx version created by the experts in the industry. Trace labs OSINT VM has the access to the most popular OSINT tools and scripts all neatly packaged under one roof. 

### Hardware

* [Lenovo Thinkpad](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpade/e14/22tpe14e4n1) - My personal opinion on Thinkpad series of Laptop is they are lightweight and efficient and do the most complex work. 
* [Raspberry pi zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) - I love this tiny credit card sized device. It has done wonders for me, and It can do more.
* [iPhone 13mini](https://www.apple.com/iphone-13/specs/) - The world in the size of 5'4-inch. 

### Apps 

My go-to launch applications for regular usage:

* [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/) - One of best light weighted and Privacy focused web-browser in the world right now. 
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/) - For all editing and to create the animated images. Its just like Adobe-suite in one pack. 
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) to edit the code and to push & commit.
* [KeepNote](http://keepnote.org/) - To take the notes and make a report of findings. I create my own KB articles here,lol.
