See what I use day-to-day for Hardware and Software

Inspired from [others](https://uses.tech/), I've listed the Hardware and Software that I use daily. 

### Software

I use a variety of software every day. Professionally, I tend to use proprietary software defined by various clients based on project needs.

* [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) - My Primary OS. For drivers & dependencies seeks community forums. 
* [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10) - My secondary OS in dual boot scenario.
