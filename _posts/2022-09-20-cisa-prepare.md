title: My CISA certification journey
---

Summer of 2022, I decided to take the [Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA)](https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cisa) exam. This was the next logical step in my career, as I had been practicing IT Security and RISK management for a while after spending several years in the Fintech sector & prestigious govt. projects. 

I choose to take the [CISA](https://www.isaca.org/credentialing/cisa) exam without any specific paid training course. I studied for a few months but only a couple of hours weekly, with a few more intense days a couple of weeks before my exam date. I found this approach to be more flexible for me. 

## What is CISA?
CISA certification is foundational course to a successful IT Audit career. 
It is governed by the world-renowned body [ISACA](https://www.isaca.org/). 
CISA can showcase your expertise and assert your ability to apply a risk-based approach to planning, executing, and reporting on audit engagements. CISA certification proves your expertise in these five work-related domains:

### CISA Domains 

```
Information Systems Auditing Process(21%)
Governance & Management of IT(17%)
Information Systems Acquisition, Development, and Implementation(12%)
Information Systems Operations & Business Resilience(23%)
Protection of Information Assets(27%)
```

## What to study for the CISA.
Officially ISACA provides CISA Online review course, CISA [Review manual 27th edition](https://store.isaca.org/s/store#/store/browse/detail/a2S4w000004KoCbEAK), and the Review Questions, Answers & Explanations database. All of this material is available at a discounted price for members. However, I prepared for my exam with experienced tutor manuals and openly available content on the internet which is completely free. 
In the first week of my preparation, I completed the video courses on CISA five domains of knowledge available on the [Linkedin Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/cisa-cert-prep-the-basics) platform; it gave me an excellent overview of the scope of the certification and the notions involved. 
The lectures I followed were by the industry-experienced tutor at [Hemang Doshi Academy](https://hemangdoshiacademy.in/). The books written by him are a perfect start for the CISA journey. 
_[Prabh Nair](https://prabhnair.in/)_ a well known Security advisor and Instructor in the Info-Sec domain. His series of videos on CISA practice question analysis helped a lot in **How to think like an Auditor** perspective. And finally, a 15-hour training video by [Dan Lachance](https://www.udemy.com/user/dan-lachance/) is available on the Youtube in two parts.

## Preparing for the CISA exam
I also took two full mock exams the day before the exam. The platform is very well done, user-friendly and clear, and it shows you how well you are prepared for the each chapter. 
I took countless practice exams and revised each domain three or four times, whichever domain I was struggling with answering. 
I was comfortable with **the technical terms of IT Audit**, even with the notions I did not really use on a daily basis. 

Then came the exam: I answered all the questions I was of and left the other ones for later. For those, I used my "CISA filter" and asked myself, "If I were a writer of this CISA questions, what would I wnat the candidate to answer? "
I have been working in an IT company environment for about 7+ years, managing IT projects, defining IT strategy or auditing IT departements of different clients-big ones, smaller ones, local and international. **So I knew I could trust my professional instinct**

_Pro tip:_ While preparing for the exam put your foot in the shoes of the Auditor and think like him.

## Exam registration:

I applied for the membership before registering for the exam. Membership cost me a total of $165 including the new member fee, and local chapter fee.  The membership gave me free access to free sample review resources and a discount on the exam registration fee at a price of $575, for non-members, it's $760. The total time of the exam is **4hours**(240mintues).
And the number of questions that need to be answered **150**. There is no negative mark for wrong answers. 

During the exam, I took my time and re-read each question several times, and even then, I did not use the entire four hours.
I took my exam under PSI online proctoring. My machine passed the [system check](https://syscheck.bridge.psiexams.com/) for requirements. The result is published immediately after successfully submitting the exam.
